 # Add true pause mode where last flow rate and PID values are maintained
 # Add "STOP" command ("[]") which acts just like the current pause command does where the PID control stopped and voltage and pressure can be set directly
 # Add max and min pressure to EEPROM storage
 # Add serial commands to change the max and min pressure
 # Create branch that uses Eclipse and AVR Plugin
 # Add PID autotune feature
