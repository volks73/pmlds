* ASL1600 Flow Meter Library for Arduino *
******************************************

Created by Christopher R. Field <christopher.field@nrl.navy.mil, cfield2@gmail.com>

A library for communicating with the ASL1600 flow meter from Sensirion. The flow meter
communicates via the RS-232 protocol with 19200 baud rate, 8 bits, 1 stop bit, and 
no parity. This library allows for simple communication from the flow meter to test
connectivity and obtain the flow rate. Not all commands for the ASL1600 have been
implemented.
